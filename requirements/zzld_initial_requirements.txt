We are building an application that is receiving as input Personal Information about an individual and then using a PDF template form to create a personalized document.
The form is ZZLD_Form.pdf and it is in the azure blob storage
All areas that have dots "...." are fields where Personal Data is supposed to be inserted replacing the dots
You need to identify these areas and create input parameters that represent them
All files stored in the Azure Blob must have unique file names
This will be part of a bigger project
